# Formidable

> It's as simple as a HTML Form

## What is it ?

Just add one drop of **Formidable** to your website and get a contact form just like that !

**Formidable** is a web service that you can send HTML Forms to, and read all the forms sent. You don't have to buy a web server for the contact form in your static website anymore.

## How does it works ?

You just need to provide the url we'll give you, add the right inputs in your form and tada ðŸŽ‰

Here are the inputs you can add (feel free to add client-side validation with HTML attributes) :

- `from` : So you can know who's sending you a message
- `object` : So you can know what people are contacting you about
- `content` : This one is actually required, you can put it inside a `textarea`

Here is a *working* example :

```html
<form action="https://formidable.site/formidable-site">
	<div>
		<label for="from">Your email</label>
		<input name="from" type="email"/>
	</div>

	<div>
		<label for="object">What's this about ?</label>
		<input name="object" type="text"/>
	</div>

	<div>
		<label for="content">Your message</label>
		<textarea name="content"/>
	</div>

</form>
```

## Roadmap

- Add mail transfer so you can receive a mail for each messages
- Add better UI to the message list (bulk actions for example)
- Add a better security option (checking if the origin url matches the registered website domain)
